This tool generates a quick report based on the mongod.log

In order to use this tool, please:

1 - Install the python3 requirements (pip3 install -r requirements.txt)
2 - Have a mongodb instance running (single instance is ok, no password needed)
3 - Remove useless logs with: cat *.log | grep -v "NETWORK" | grep -v "ACCESS" | grep -v "STORAGE" > newlog.json
4 - Import the mongod log using mongoimport 
mongoimport -d <databasename> -c <collectionname> --host <hosname> newlog.json
This will load all the log data into a mongodb instance

4 - Execute the report.py

This script will generate a new folder with several file, open the index.html

i.e: python3 report.py -d slowqueries -c logs -u "mongodb://127.0.0.1" -l 30 -f report08

Where:
 -d is the database you will connect 
 -c is the collection the script will run the aggregates
 -u is the mongodb uri
 -l is the limit of rows for each session
 -f is the folder name that will be created.


Feel free to change the script, I only tested it on Linux.
